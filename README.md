## byi/dni

BYI // When I first meet people, I can be pretty socially awkward and might seem to avoid conversations. It's not that I don't want to chat; it's just that I find it hard to hold a conversation with someone new, so please give me a little time to open up.

I go by he/him pronouns, though I dont mind if anyone calls me by they/them.

Im currently struggling pretty roughly with my identity, so if things are switched up or changed ill definitely appreciate your understanding and patience.

I can come off super blunt and dry, I'm not trying to upset you nor am I upset. Expressing emotion through text is hard haha.

I tend to form attachments easily. please only friend me with me if you're genuinely interested in chatting and building a friendship. don't friend me just to never talk again.

DNI // 18+, sorry!! , basic DNI, endogenic systems are on thin ice, saying slurs you can't reclaim, other than that i block freely

im not completely against endogenic systems because I understand there are situations where a genuinely traumagenic system might mistakenly identify as endogenic. however, if youre using the endogenic label for self gain, I won't hesitate to block you. but getting straight to the point, endogenic systems approach me with caution.
